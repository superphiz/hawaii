## Who is it?

This is an open event. Ideally it would include people who are interested in Ethereum and their families. There is no formal registration process. To maintain the security and privacy of attendees and their families, members may choose not to disclose their attendance and just show up. 

## What is it?

HodlerCon 2022

## Where is it?

As of June 15,2021, the event location will be on a Hawaiian island, but the specific details haven't been worked out. Please [refer to the discord](https://discord.gg/ZC8Su6h4QQ) for the most up-to-date details.

## When is it?

Friday, June 17, 2022 to Sunday, June 26, 2022. (9 days)

## What are the conditions?

**This section is being left for posterity, the trip has the green light and planning is in progress!**

If Ether is trading above $1420 on Tuesday, June 15, 2021, the event will be greenlighted. This essentially means that anyone who said they were going is going to sell their Hawaii stash around June 15 and begin buying plane tickets, booking hotels, etc. It's important to note that the price of Ether may exceed $1420 before that date, but it must be trading ABOVE $1420 on Tuesday, June 15, 2021 to greenlight the trip. Hodlers should plan to sell enough to cover the trip and expenses at that time. The year in advance means we'll be able to book the resort as soon as reservations open, one year before the stay.

## What will the event be like?

This is first and foremost a chance for people to visit Hawaii with their family to celebrate the success of Ethereum, secondary to that goal it's a chance for Ethfinancier's to get together and shoot the shit. Meals and gatherings will be penciled in before we go, but the true point is to relax and spend time with your family and people you kind of know from the Internet. Any participant may make arrangements and announce them and/or invite others to join in, participants may create novelty ERC 721 tokens, and do any sort of additional organizing that they choose, but the core concept of the trip is purposefully disorganized.

## Estimating cost

Now is the BEST time to earmark your Ether for this trip! Set it aside, put it in a special place. If the trip happens you'll be ready to go. Here's a rough attempt at estimating the cost for the trip for a family of 3:
